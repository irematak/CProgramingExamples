## DOOR KEY CROSSWORD  
There are 100 doors. The doors enumerated 1 to 100. All doors are locked.  
We have got 20 keys that enumerated 1 to 20.  
If the key's number fully divided by the door's number then this key can lock or open this door.  
We try every door with each key. After the 20th tour which doors opened and locked?
